# LLM Text Detection

### Motivation:
The project aims to develop a text classification application to identify essays generated by Language Model Models (LLMs). Educators are concerned that LLMs may enable plagiarism, hindering students' skill development by allowing them to submit essays that are not their own. The application intends to address this issue by detecting essays produced with the assistance of LLMs.
